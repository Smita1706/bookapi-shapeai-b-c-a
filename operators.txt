MongoDB Operators  -> Powerfull yet devs won't use them

Arrays [1,2,3,4]
1) $push  It pushesh perticular element in array.
2) $pop   It delete the last element from the array
3) $pull  It will delete specific element you have to specify element that you want to delete
      example:  $pull{ authors: 1 }   
4) $addToSet -> clever way of pushing data into array
     It checks for unique ness .
     if the element is already present it will not add that element again in array.

$inc   (++)  $inc{postCount :+1} for increment 
             $inc{postCount :-1} for decrement
$min         $min{amount}
             balance:2000->$min{balance:200}
             this will check that the balance given inn the min is small if yes then 
             update it by 2000
             if no then skip.
$max         same as min.
$set         create new key and add value.
         $set{
             familyCount:5
            }
$unset     delete perticular key value pair.
            $unset{
             familyCount:5
            }

Book.update(
   { sku: "new value" },
   {    
       $unset: { quantity: "", instock: "" },
        $inc: { postCount: +2 } 
    }
)
